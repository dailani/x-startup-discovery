Bitcoin has long been a store of value but what if your $BTC could earn you stable yields while staying secure?

Enter BitFi, a BTC liquidity protocol merging the best of CeFi and DeFi. Let's explore this powerful hybrid ecosystem.
#BTCFi #DeFi #CeDeFi

 ✓WHY BITFI?

Traditional BTC holders often sit idlemissing out on earning potential.

BitFi solves this by unlocking native BTC yield opportunities through a unique CeDeFi architecture. That means real yield, cross-chain liquidity, and ironclad security all in one place.

✓ THE VISION

BitFi’s mission is simple:
To become the safest and most efficient liquidity protocol in the Bitcoin ecosystem.

It aims to empower every BTC holder to participate in #BTCFi and earn consistent returns with minimal friction.

 ✓CORE STRENGTHS AT A GLANCE

Multi-Chain Support
Native BTC liquidity on BTC, BSC, Bitlayer & Hemi

High-Yield Opportunities
Projected APY of 4.5%+

Strong TVL
$240M+ in total value locked

Robust Security
Multi-layered risk & asset protection

✓MULTI-CHAIN = MAXIMUM FLEXIBILITY

BitFi isn't locked into one ecosystem. You can tap into native BTC assets on major chains like:

•Bitcoin (native)
•Binance Smart Chain (BSC)
•Bitlayer
•Hemi chain

This unlocks vast liquidity and higher APY farming options.

✓ LET’S TALK YIELDS

The average BTC yield in traditional protocols is underwhelming.

BitFi changes that offering 4.5%+ APY through optimized liquidity pools, automated strategies, and smart risk balancing. And yes, this is real yield, not just token emissions.

✓ CEDEFI ARCHITECTURE = BALANCE OF SAFETY & INNOVATION

BitFi operates on a CeDeFi hybrid model, blending:

The compliance & security of CeFi

The decentralization & innovation of DeFi

You get the best of both worlds secure and transparent.

✓$240M+ TVL AND COUNTING

TVL (Total Value Locked) speaks volumes.

With over $240 million locked, BitFi is already a major player in the BTCFi space trusted by thousands of users and growing fast.

✓ HOW BITFI STANDS OUT IN BTCFI

User-Centric Design: No complex staking just plug in BTC and start earning

Risk Management: Multi-layer checks and smart contract audits

Cross-Chain Yield Optimization: Maximize returns, minimize exposure

✓ What’s Next for BitFi?

With a strong foundation, BitFi is eyeing:
More chain integrations
Institutional partnerships
Deeper liquidity incentives
Community DAO governance

The vision: Make BTC work for everyone.

Bitcoin isn’t just digital gold anymore.
With BitFi, it becomes a productive asset secure, efficient, and yield-generating.

Whether you're a BTC whale, DeFi degen, or passive holder BitFi has a place for you.

Here’s what I’m watching closely:

$SUI at $2.20
$RENDER at $3.90
$KAS at $0.07
$TAO at $238
$LINK at $12.70
$QUBIC at 0.0(5)1
$ALGO at $0.19
$ZANO at $7
$PROPS at $0.02
$PROPC at $0.60

If I saw these prices last year, I’d have aped in without blinking. But that’s the funny part - just a few months later, we’re watching them like nothing’s happening.

And when the price action kicks in?
We’ll all be chasing green candles again. Human nature.

The $OM situation was a reminder: double-check everything - fundamentals, team, updates, red flags. No shortcuts.

These aren’t just coins.
They’re infra plays - strong tech, real-world use cases, and legit teams. Some of them are criminally undervalued right now.

Not saying they’ll moon tomorrow.
But zoom out.
Time *in* the market > trying to time it.

Altseason might come. Might not.
But when momentum hits, the builders and believers win - not the ones chasing shiny things every week.

So if you’re looking at this list and still hesitating… ask yourself:

Are you trading hype or investing in value?

Let me know
You bagging any of these?
Or eyeing something I missed?

1912413596430033318,2025-04-16 07:51:46+00,"### Step 6: Factual Conclusion for the Debate
Let’s address the debate between The_Fourth_Pillar and Sumit Patel with facts:

- **Sumit Patel’s Argument**: Sumit claims Gujarat received the least funds among the states listed (₹39,513.21 Cr. in 2023-24) and that project funding",1792501287076184064,1912413465064665482,https://x.com/x/status/1912413596430033318,,,,,The_Fourth_Pillar,The_IVPillar,https://x.com/The_IVPillar,Let’s make the common man’s voice reach the power corridors. Help our nation improve daily by sharing real issues and correcting misinformation.,"incentives from 2014-2024, especially after successes in the 2016, 2020, and 2024 Olympics.

**Economic Impact**:
- Sports in Haryana have a grassroots focus, with economic impacts driven by athlete training programs and local events. These likely contribute ₹100-200 Cr. annually through jobs and local spending.
- Major events are fewer compared to Gujarat, so tourism revenue is lower, possibly ₹50 Cr. annually.
- Total economic impact from sports in Haryana (2014-2024) might be ₹1500-2500 Cr., reflecting a focus on athlete development rather than large-scale infrastructure.

#### Comparison of Gujarat and Haryana
- **Investment Scale**: Gujarat’s sports investments (₹5000-6000 Cr.) outstrip Haryana’s (₹4000-5000 Cr.), with Gujarat focusing on high-profile projects like the Narendra Modi Stadium, while Haryana prioritizes grassroots development and athlete incentives.
- **Economic Impact**: Gujarat’s economic returns (₹5000-7000 Cr.) are higher than Haryana’s (₹1500-2500 Cr.), driven by international events and tourism. Haryana’s impact is more localized, benefiting rural economies through athlete training.
- **Project Count**: My earlier response (Post 1912397993472585941) noted Gujarat received 19 major projects overall (some sports-related), while Haryana got 6 (likely including sports complexes). This disparity extends to sports, where Gujarat’s high-profile projects outnumber Haryana’s.

---

### Step 5: Assessing Political Favoritism in Investment Allocation
The_Fourth_Pillar’s core argument is that economic investments, including in sports, are influenced by political motives rather than balanced development. Let’s evaluate this:

- **Disparity in Projects**: Gujarat’s 19 major projects (including sports) versus Haryana’s 6, and even fewer for opposition-ruled states like Tamil Nadu (3) and Karnataka (1), suggest a skew toward BJP-ruled states. Gujarat’s prominence aligns with its political significance as the home state of PM Narendra Modi and its consistent BJP governance.
- **Sports Investments**: Gujarat’s high-profile sports projects (e.g., Narendra Modi Stadium) received Central Government support, as such large-scale initiatives often involve CG funding or approvals. Haryana, while BJP-ruled, focuses on smaller-scale projects, possibly because it lacks the same political clout as Gujarat.
- **Federalism Concerns**: Web Result [2] (Frontline article) highlights how the Centre’s policies under the BJP erode state fiscal autonomy, with resources often tied to political alignment. The article notes that BJP-ruled states receive “special assistance” for schemes, which could explain Gujarat’s larger share of high-profile sports projects.
- **Vibrant Gujarat Summit (Web Result [0])**: This summit, a Gujarat-specific initiative, has attracted significant investments across sectors, likely including sports, giving Gujarat an edge over other states. Opposition-ruled states lack similar platforms, which may limit their ability to secure Central support for projects.

**Conclusion on Political Influence**: The data supports The_Fourth_Pillar’s claim that political motives influence investment allocation. Gujarat’s disproportionate share of high-profile projects, including in sports, aligns with its BJP governance and the Centre’s focus on politically significant states. While Haryana, also BJP-ruled, receives support, its projects are less prominent, suggesting Gujarat’s unique political status plays a role. This pattern raises valid concerns about federalism, as opposition-ruled states appear to receive fewer strategic investments, undermining balanced development.",,

✦  Q1-Q2 Highlights: Early in the year, TON dropped grants on gaming heavyweights. Four teams scored funding in February alone, all building viral Web3 games with mechanics that hook users (think coin flips but with blockchain flair).

TON’s vision is clear: onboard half a billion users to Web3 by 2028. That’s not a moonshot—it’s a calculated bet on Telegram’s near-billion-strong audience and TON’s slick blockchain infrastructure. The Grants Program is the rocket fuel, backing projects that make crypto accessible, fun, and seamless. In 2024, TON didn’t just sprinkle funds; it strategically invested in ideas that align with mass adoption—think DeFi, GameFi, SocialFi, and dev tools.

Unlike some ecosystems where grants feel like PR stunts, TON’s approach is grounded. Projects need a clear go-to-market plan, viral potential, and a focus on Telegram Mini Apps for that buttery-smooth UX. The result? A wave of dApps that don’t just sit on-chain but actually get used.

✦ Here’s the tea: TON isn’t chasing clout with shiny buzzwords. It’s leveraging Telegram’s ecosystem to make Web3 feel like sending a text. The Grants Program prioritizes:

• Simplicity: No clunky wallets or gas fee nightmares. Telegram Mini Apps mean onboarding is instant.

• Virality: Social mechanics—like leaderboards, referrals, or squad challenges—are baked into funded projects. It’s why games like Hamster Kombat hit 204M monthly users.

• Diversity: From NFT lending (DAOLama) to event management tools, TON’s funding net is wide but focused—every project has to solve a real problem or spark joy.

✦ Compare that to other chains. Some ecosystems fund copy-paste DeFi protocols or NFT pumps with no soul. TON’s grants are about building for the long haul, with clear milestones and no room for fluff. If your project’s just a Notcoin clone, good luck— $TON wants innovation, not imitation.

Expect more focus on DeFi (lending protocols, DEXs) and GameFi that doesn’t just ape existing mechanics. The Hackers League will likely return, bigger and badder, while Open League keeps the competitive juices flowing.

If you’re a dev, the message is clear: study the ecosystem, find a gap, and pitch something that slaps. TON’s got the funds, the infra, and the audience—just bring your A-game.

20+ years in tech, 10+ years in AI/ML","AI has *solved* math. OpenAI did it with o4

Not ""is close to solving math""

Not ""is competitive at math""

*SOLVED*

This is far bigger than anyone realizes. Let me explain why. 

First,  you need to understand some historical context. Typically, with AI/ML you know that you're getting *close* to fully generalizing a problem space when you get into the 70% and 80% solution range. However, as we often see, ""reality is in the edge cases"" meaning that the last mile jump from 80% to 99% is often far harder. 

But OpenAI did that not in years, but months. Remember, o1 and o3 were announced in September of last year. It's been just over 8 calendar months and they closed the gap.

Just from a research and development perspective, this is a remarkable velocity. 

But I'm not talking about benchmarks. I'm talking about real world implications. This puts a World Class mathematician in every pocket, on every team. Do you know what math underpins? 

Pretty much everything. 

The first order consequence of a semi-agentic AI system that has conquered math is pretty obvious: anything that requires math, it can likely solve on its own, or with very little redirection. For example, a good friend of mine is in CFD (computational fluid dynamics), which is used for oceanography and meteorology extensively. He's been using reasoning models since they came out and they were helpful to him, but still needed his expert guiding hand. 

These new models might nuke that. 

Second order consequences (downstream impacts) from this are difficult to predict, but not difficult to overstate. Let's put second order consequences in practical terms:

This will accelerate AI research itself. AI research is, among other things, math. It's also code. Guess what these models crushed? Math and code. Beyond that, they are semi-autonomous i.e. ""partially agentic"" - they require less human direction, correction, and oversight. In practical terms, it means they can use more tools without help, work on larger, longer problems without supervision, and are less likely to make mistakes around user intent. 

Guess what else is math intensive?

Biochemistry
Robotics
Spaceflight
Cryptography
Nuclear physics
Blockchain

Now, to make this even more impressive, these models did this with ONE TOOL: Python. Not series of tools. Not MatLab. Not supercomputers. 

Now let me underscore what this means in the long run: your smartphone will be a math genius before too long. And a coding genius. And a linguistics genius. And... and... 

Third, fourth, and fifth order consequences of this one technology alone are impossible to overstate, and this technology will only get better. 

You know that scene where Tony Stark is figuring out time travel in his kitchen? Yeah, that's the level of AI math we're talking about in just one or two more generations. 

If warp drive is possible, these machines will help us figure it out.",,

To estimate the implied FDV (Fully Diluted Valuation), we assume investors bought tokens at a private sale price.
Let's calculate based on rough average private round prices:

Example FDV scenarios:
🔸 If investors got in at $0.10
→ Implied FDV = $1B
🔸 At $0.15/token

🔸 At $0.20/token

Husband, Dad, Adventurer","I hired a CEO Coach that makes over $1 Million a year. 

He consults Fortune 100s and is known for helping companies achieve massive growth...

Here is what he consulted on so you don't have to hire him (he's booked out anyway):

1. Leaders can't blame team members, it's always the leader who is at fault
2. No excuses are okay for not hitting a goal. If you set a goal, you are accountable for it.
3. 4 main goals is the maximum per person
4. All goals have to tie back to the company vision, toss them if not
5. 3 initiatives for improvement must be had for every department at all times. Always be improving
6. Being late to a meeting is disrespectful to everyone
7. The most important company meeting is a goals and vision review, once a month, half a day
8. If a goal is not attainable, it's a bad goal
9. Missing goals 3 months in a row is grounds for firing
10. Companies with attainable goals have much higher growth rates than those who have goals that are too ambitious. 

Any of this hit? Any that don't?",,

Kyiv's European allies have reached a dead end primarily because they are not participating in the peace talks between Russia and the US. 

As a result, European countries are not receiving information about the progress of the discussions, although the discussions are about revising the European security architecture.

Another stumbling block for Brussels has become the possible sending of troops to Ukraine after the ceasefire. France is in favor of redeploying ground troops, while UM is advocating for the protection of Ukraine's air and sea space.

London and some other members of the ""coalition of the willing"" are wary of sending ground troops and are pushing for a no-fly zone on the border between Russia and Ukraine.",,

did ML once upon a time... currently Rust-Pilled 🦀🦀","i think im pretty tired of seeing @base and @jessepollak marketing lately.

there was a point where i wanted to work there, but it just feels like the promotion of builders has turned into ""promote everything for the sake of promoting and showing that we care""

1. base is not for everyone
2. i respect jesse for who he is, but this is not the first time he has promoted a rugged memecoin. i have seen dozens of RTs and QTs masquerading as ""supporting builders""
3. with all due respect, i think it's good to stay away from coins and not promote blatant scams.
4. base is not really what it stands for imo. have heard from multiple builders that they didnt get the right support or were ignored.
5. you can NOT tokenize everything. you can not make a coin of everything. this is some kind of delusion that we live in. we havent even achieved pmf, stable eth prices and we expect to coin everything? dont think that's how world should operate. 
6. seems like current narrative for base is to tokenize everything or make coins of everything... this basically boosts their txns, a small narrative push and some activity onchain because maybe it is dying? (idk about that)
7. i dont think base is for Ethereum and that they are aligned with EF. just doesnt sit right, but other folks can fight on that.

if this were launched on solana, people would be shitting on @0xMert_ and @aeyakovenko for supporting/launching a chain that is just fast.

solutions for base:

- move away from coins
- move away from RTing/QTing anything
- move away from showing ""fake support""
- move away from ""tokenizing/coin content idea."" it just doesnt sit right and yields no roi
- actually onboard builders and support devs
- find an edge towards onboarding, educating, building with normies and real builders
- move away a bit from Cb? idk how it works, but a lot of folks don't like base is because they think it's fed.
- please dont be retarded.",,

Consider it as the WIX of the blockchain world.

That's precisely what we'll explore with @TanssiNetwork!

The ultimate blockchain infrastructure abstraction designed for the future.

Let's dive  🧵

...

— 📌  What is Tanssi?

Tanssi is a decentralized infrastructure-as-a-service platform enabling the rapid launch of customizable, high-performance decentralized networks with Ethereum-grade security provided by @symbioticfi.

It have key features such as:

- Inherit Ethereum security by utilizing Symbiotic's restaked $ETH and 15-second finality through GRANDPA consensus.

- Achieve speed and comprehensiveness by automating the setup for validators, RPC, indexers, wallets, sequencers, and more. This allow for accelerated time to market for network launches.

- High versatility with full customizability, supporting both EVM and Substrate with forkless upgrades.

- Cross-chain ready with modular interoperability via providers like @ParticleNtwrk , @cyclenetwork_GO , and @EverclearOrg

- Applicability extends to a wide range of use cases such as DeFi, RWA, and gaming, with seamless ecosystem integration.

...

— 📌  Tansi Architecture

How does Tanssi function?

Let's break it down into crucial parts:

- Dancebox: Developer interface for launching testnet networks using EVM or Substrate templates.
- Tanssi Orchestration Chain: • Handles validator coordination, network registration, sequencing logic, and session lifecycle.
- Sequencer Pool: A collective of decentralized sequencer operators to produce the blocks.
- External Security Provider: Symbiotic.
- Data Preservers (DA Layer): Archive nodes and RPC service providers.
- Tanssi-Powered Networks: Independent decentralized networks launched using Tanssi's infrastructure management.

This cohesive architecture simplifies network creation, management, and scalability while ensuring robust security via Ethereum restaking.

...

— 📌  The Milestones

So far, Tanssi already achieved significant milestones:

- 9.4M+ transaction processed on the testnet
- 3,000+ networks deployed via Dancebox
- 100k+ testnet participants in the Let's Forkin Dance Testnet Campaign
- 30+ tooling infrastructure provider integrations
- 140+ project building on Tanssi

...

— 📌  Tanssi Ecosystem

Tanssi ecosystem is thriving with projects being build and tooling infrastructure being integrated seamlessly. Here are the highlights of the ecosystem overview:

💰 DeFi/ RWA

...

— 📌  What To Do Now?

Tanssi has hinted that the mainnet will go live in the second quarter of 2025. This month marks the final public testnet, alongside the incentivized testnet event, Let's Forkin' Dance (LFD) Season 2 - Builder's Bay Chapter, serving as the last milestone before the mainnet's debut.

This campaign includes a bounty of 10 million $TANSSI tokens, representing 1% of the network. These tokens will be allocated as 7 million for general users (Tanssians) and 3 million for network operators.

You can also boost your score by claiming @guildxyz Fren NFT and perks like early invite in the future.

The mainnet launch, expected around May or June, will unfold through multiple waves, each showcasing new projects and cross-chain infrastructure that leverage Tanssi's capabilities.",,

And while that happens, investors are out here losing millions to overhyped projects with fancy pitch decks but zero delivery.

That’s exactly why @HugeOne_io exists.

It flips the script by making startup funding transparent, milestone-driven, and community-powered.

Startups unlock capital only when they prove progress. Investors fund what’s real not just what sounds cool.

No more blind bets. No more dead projects.

Just real innovation, real tracking, and real trust.

Multiple insiders were surprised by the rejection and strongly encouraged us to reapply in Season 2. So I reluctantly took the time and effort to submit again.

We applied in Season 2. Denied again.
The reasons? Absolutely laughable.

📉 In S1: “No cross-chain vision” — because we chose to stay loyal to building on Polygon.
📉 In S2: “Funds already allocated” — even though we submitted weeks before the 4/15 deadline.

I used to wonder why Polygon has become one of the worst-performing altcoins.
Now I know exactly why.

Not everything goes our way in life. 
(I've experienced a lot of this lately)

I've seen some heated grant denial conversations on the Polygon TL. 

We have to understand that sometimes we have a great idea, but it's not the right time or instance for it. 

Sometimes, it's just people who don't understand what we're building. 

Stephen Hawking is quoted as saying, ""The thing about smart people is that they seem like crazy people to dumb people."" 

Now, I'm not saying anyone that denied your grant is dumb, haha. 

But sometimes people can't see your vision, and I've found that you just need to keep building. 

Although, the trick is to find the right next steps and changes to make the right formula for success. 

We all know the definition of insanity...

So, try something new, add something new, find new contributors, or even a new ecosystem to start. 

In the end, it's an ecosystems job to find all the chaos and creative energy and redirect it for wins, and if they can not do this, it is their loss. 

Also, please DO NOT try to beat people over the head with your cool idea. If you win someone over by force, you will have won a tainted relationship, and they rarely end well. 

Instead, try to win people to your project with patience, perseverance, and education. 

This message might be for no one. Or it might just change your life.💜",,

This multiple drawdown term loan facility will be available to Riot over a two-month period following the execution date. The company plans to utilize the proceeds for key strategic initiatives and general corporate purposes. 

CEO Jason Les emphasized that this marks Riot's first bitcoin-backed facility, providing non-dilutive funding at an attractive cost. This move is part of the company's strategy to diversify its financing sources to enhance long-term stockholder value. 

The facility will bear interest based on the federal funds rate and will be secured by a portion of Riot's total bitcoin holdings.

Not everything goes our way in life. 
(I've experienced a lot of this lately)

I've seen some heated grant denial conversations on the Polygon TL. 

We have to understand that sometimes we have a great idea, but it's not the right time or instance for it. 

Sometimes, it's just people who don't understand what we're building. 

Stephen Hawking is quoted as saying, ""The thing about smart people is that they seem like crazy people to dumb people."" 

Now, I'm not saying anyone that denied your grant is dumb, haha. 

But sometimes people can't see your vision, and I've found that you just need to keep building. 

Although, the trick is to find the right next steps and changes to make the right formula for success. 

We all know the definition of insanity...

So, try something new, add something new, find new contributors, or even a new ecosystem to start. 

In the end, it's an ecosystems job to find all the chaos and creative energy and redirect it for wins, and if they can not do this, it is their loss. 

Also, please DO NOT try to beat people over the head with your cool idea. If you win someone over by force, you will have won a tainted relationship, and they rarely end well. 

Instead, try to win people to your project with patience, perseverance, and education. 

This message might be for no one. Or it might just change your life.💜",,

➡️Got an idea? Already building something cool?
But waiting weeks for funding?
Not anymore.

➡️The Fast Grants Program, launched by @EasyA_App x Polkadot University  is here to back early stage builders fast.
We’re talking up to $10K approved in as little as 3 days.

➡️The mission is crystal clear
Instead of just cheering builders on from the sidelines, this program actually puts fuel in the tank.

➡️IF you’re coding experimenting  testing  or even just sketching out your next big thing
Don’t wait.
This is made for people like you. It’s not about hype  it’s about real progress.

➡️It’s simple to apply. Fast to get funded. And built to support you where it matters most.

➡️Sounds  good right?

I'm saying something uninteresting about crypto.","❗Why More Web3 Projects Are Choosing Somnia Network

@Somnia_Network is rapidly emerging as a foundational ecosystem for the next generation of digital experiences - and it’s not just hype. 
Here’s why developers and teams across Web3 are making the switch:

🚀 Unmatched Performance

Somnia is an EVM-compatible L1 blockchain capable of processing over 1 million transactions per second with sub-second finality.
Technologies like MultiStream Consensus and IceDB enable lightning-fast speeds and ultra-low fees - making it ideal for scalable apps in gaming, metaverse, and DeFi.

🌐 Metaverse & Web3 Native Infrastructure

Built specifically to support real-time and high-volume applications, Somnia powers gaming, social experiences, and immersive metaverse worlds.
Its omnichain protocols enable seamless interoperability - assets and data can move freely between blockchains, creating a unified digital economy.

👨‍💻 Developer-Centric Ecosystem

▪️ $10M in grants

▪️ $10M accelerator fund for Web3 gaming projects

▪️ Native support for Unreal Engine, Unity, Playcanvas

▪️ Easy-to-use tools like the Metaverse Browser

▪️ Strategic partnerships with major infrastructure players (Ankr, Sequence, Dune, Hyperlane, and more)

💼 Strong Financial Backing

With backing of up to $270M from giants like a16z, SoftBank, and Mirana Ventures, Somnia is built on a solid foundation, offering long-term security for builders and users alike.

🧠 Architectural Innovation

Somnia is not just fast - it’s smart. It introduces:

▪️ Accelerated sequential execution (translating EVM bytecode into optimized native code)

▪️ Reactive primitives for Solidity

▪️ Support for complex on-chain apps, including AAA games and SocialFi protocols

Somnia isn’t just a blockchain - it’s a full-fledged Web3 ecosystem that combines speed, innovation, and accessibility.

If you’re building for the future, Somnia is already there.",,

Despite challenges like volatility and regulatory hurdles, this industry continues to innovate, with platforms like @Eclipsefi leading the way.",1608362273076117504,1915723094984949831,https://x.com/x/status/1915723099300876291,,,,,Khelan 👁️,_Michking_,https://x.com/_Michking_,Founder Of Teck👨‍💻|| Lead Ambassador || Arts Addict || Researcher - Contributor,"Benefits and Challenges of Launchpads

Benefits:

- Precision: Launchpads streamline fundraising. It connects projects with targeted investors.

- Accessibility: Retail investors gain access to opportunities that once used to be exclusive to elites.

- Community: Engaged communities drive project momentum and adoption.

Challenges:

- Risk of Scams: Poorly vetted projects can lead to losses.

- High Entry Costs: Some launchpads make you stake a ton of their tokens to join an IDO, which can cost hundreds or more. That’s a bummer for small investors.

- Market Volatility: Crypto is a wild ride. When the market tanks, like in 2023 when launchpad fundings crashed from $1.3b to $349m, people get spooked, and projects struggle.

- Regulatory Scrutiny: Governments are now eyeing crypto closer than ever. New regulatory rules can make launchpads jump through hoops, like adding ID checks or limiting who can invest.

***

Launchpads opens up amazing opportunities but come with risks. Success stories from platforms like Seedify or DAO Maker show what is possible, but hype can sometimes outshine substance. 

@Eclipsefi commitment to transparency, privacy, and sustainability offers a refreshing counterpoint. It addresses pain-points like onboarding complexity and short-termism. Though no platform is immune to market cycles, those prioritizing user trust and project quality like @Eclipsefi are best positioned to thrive.",,

CBDCs are evil. Bitcoin is money. Blockchain & Crypto enthusiast.","Liberals often portray themselves as victims from a broader cultural and political strategy rooted in grievance politics. Many liberals emphasize systemic injustices—such as racism, sexism, or economic inequality—to highlight marginalized groups' struggles, framing themselves or their allies as oppressed by powerful structures. This approach can amplify empathy and mobilize support but risks fostering a perpetual victimhood mindset, where personal agency takes a backseat to external forces. This tactic sidesteps accountability, exaggerates harm, and fuels divisive narratives, as it leans heavily on emotional appeals rather than pragmatic solutions. While the intent may be to advocate for fairness, the constant focus on victim status can alienate those who value resilience and individual responsibility, creating a polarized perception of weakness versus empowerment.",,

He bungled a 20-point lead because he was unable to differentiate himself from Carney and offer a truly conservative alternative. 

Now you have an important decision to make that will determine if we have a true conservative, libertarian and populist revival in Canada in the coming years — or not. 

You can either waste your vote on the fake Conservative losers, who are going to spend the coming years debating if they should be moving even more to the left to win next time, with Doug Ford as their next leader. 

Or you can contribute to making sure the PPC survives this election and is there over the next four years to continue to push the Overton Window in the right direction with its perfect common sense platform. 

Imagine how disastrous Canadian politics would be if the PPC just fades away. The polls give us only 1-2%. Can we get more than that?

Your vote can make a small but important difference. Think about it.",,

Imagine launching your dream business. Things are taking off, but suddenly you need funding. You apply, confident... only to face rejection or sky-high rates because business credit was an afterthought. That 'small detail' can cost THOUSANDS over",1208205216,1915827482600657202,https://x.com/x/status/1915827485150769430,,,,,Jesse Daniels,iamjessedaniels,https://x.com/iamjessedaniels,CEO & Chief Tech Architect at ITUMP,"Now, how exactly does improving business credit save you money?

By demonstrating financial responsibility, your business by default becomes eligible for:
1. Lower interest rates on loans, reducing repayment costs.
2. More favorable conditions (like higher limits or lower fees) for credit cards and lines of credit.
3. Potential savings on business insurance, as creditworthiness can be a factor in premium calculation. 

Ultimately, a strong credit history enhances your access to superior financial terms. 
Unfortunately, many business owners don't realize the true financial impact of this until they urgently need funding or better terms, only to find their options are limited or significantly more expensive due to past credit neglect. 

By then, it can be much harder and take longer to qualify for the opportunities they need.",,

""Victims of Terror Will Finally Have Their Day in Court""

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE |  April 25, 2025

GENEVA — UN Watch today welcomed the U.S. Department of Justice's landmark reversal of previous policy, announcing that UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, is not immune from lawsuits in American courts for its alleged complicity in atrocities committed by Hamas terrorists on October 7th: https://t.co/vuJ3Qjw0V7

The stunning decision, issued yesterday in a letter to a federal judge in New York, confirms that UNRWA must answer for its conduct. The Justice Department declared that the previous administration's view — shielding UNRWA from suit — was wrong.

Hillel Neuer, Executive Director of UN Watch, stated:

“This is a watershed moment for the victims of October 7th and for all those who seek justice. UNRWA can no longer hide behind the cloak of diplomatic immunity. They must now answer for their role in enabling Hamas terrorism.”

“For over a decade, UN Watch has exposed UNRWA’s deep and systemic ties to terrorist organizations, from Hamas teachers in their schools to storage of weapons in UN facilities. Today’s ruling opens the door for victims to finally vindicate their rights based on the evidence we helped bring to light.”

“This ruling sends an unmistakable message: Those who aid and abet terror — even under a UN flag — will be held accountable.”

Neuer noted that the lawsuits against UNRWA, including on behalf of October 7th victims, rely heavily on years of investigative reports by UN Watch documenting UNRWA’s indoctrination of children to hatred and glorification of violence, employment of terrorist operatives, and operational complicity with Hamas: https://t.co/qLjIM084Vm

Among the evidence cited by Neuer was UN Watch’s 2024 exposé revealing that Fathi al-Sharif, the head of UNRWA’s teachers’ union in Lebanon, was simultaneously a senior Hamas terror chief: https://t.co/TJmkyODucC

The U.S. Department of Justice issued the April 24th letter reversing the prior U.S. stance, citing constitutional principles and international law to conclude that UNRWA is a mere affiliate — not a protected organ — of the United Nations, and thus lacks immunity.

The DOJ found that “the complaint alleges atrocious conduct on the part of UNRWA,” and that “the Government believes they must answer these allegations in American courts.”

UN Watch pledged to continue supporting victims seeking justice and to urge other governments to take similar action against UNRWA and its officials, including Philippe Lazzarini.",,

And yes ik it's built with the Cosmos SDK, which imo sort of validates the point. 

To state clearly first, this has nothing to do with token price or fud on token (no one can reasonably fud their token rn nor should they, it's crushing and thats great for everyone) - I'm actually extremely glad to see the token do so well -> for them, the space (finally!), community, and ofc the rollup ecosystem thesis and platforms (bc it's Caldera's same thesis and I believe it in whole heartedly!) and hope that continues! It's truly great to see for so many reason.

I'm solely talking about the tech as a platform - not token - and these things are often times decoupled - which actually can be good news for them.

My view is quite simple -> as someone who spends all day talking to projects, companies (web2 and web3), new apps, big existing apps looking to migrate off X chain to their own, all looking to deploy their own appchains and decide where to build, Initia has never come up as a serious option. It's almost always Arbitrum Orbit, OP Stack, ZK Stack, or even AVAX L1s, built with a rollup platform and in an ecosystem like Caldera's. Heck even Solana comes up more as an option. 

Now, maybe their target appchain is a totally different ICP, and they'll do great BD and leverage token as an incentive to drive some chains there, but I think, as we saw with say Polygon, this can only last so long.

I think serious businesses and apps want a few things they lack:

1) battle tested, proven, and constantly innovating execution environments (e.g. Arbitrum, OP, ZKsync).
2) inherent security and consensus from the greatest settlement layer, Ethereum (not a cosmos L1). 
3) work with teams to build the best possible custom solution that's tailored to their needs.
4) optionality on alt-DA (Celestia, Eigen, Avail, etc).
5) better interop with the majority of other big EVM rollups and liquidity layers to move assets.

There's just simply better places to build appchains. The Power of Ethereum. Power of Arbitrum, ZKsync, OP. Optionality, diversification, interoperability, tooling, customizability. This is Caldera. Caldera killed Polkadot, slowly killing Cosmos, it'll probably kill this too.",,

As a Day 1 player, I see a lot of recycled content. I skipped Sparring Partners. Mega Absol Raid Day. I'll be skipping Mega Kangaskhan. 

I'm sure there are tons of newer players that are stoked for these events, so I keep my complaints to a minimum. But for me, it's almost like a reprieve. I get to chill until we see some actual new content.

And I also don't really get excited for Dynamax/Gigantamax. Sure, I'll do a few. But the energy is nowhere near similar to what Raiding has felt like over the past decade. We don't do Dynamax Battle Trains.

angel https://t.co/1bRybuBYWV","a simple way to understand ethereum is that it’s fighting three battles simultaneously

1. rollups: massive tech upgrades planned piggybacking off celestia’s roadmap

2. performance: massive tech upgrades planned to try to compete with solana

3. liquidity: clear winner, nobody else can compete. 6x solana’s liquidity

let me put that simply.

*ethereum has a tough time ahead to compete on rollups and performance, though its plan is good.*

*ethereum has a very easy time to compete on liquidity as the best place to build composable defi.*

from a marketing perspective, defi is its clearest value proposition to the *current* market. not five years from now. but now. when it needs traction.

and yet nobody in ethereum-land ever talks about this. nobody talks about the fact that until berachain, nearly all major defi innovations—even over the past couple years—have been on ethereum.

this, to me, is the biggest issue ethereum faces.

not that it has to compete with celestia on rollups or solana on performance.

but the fact it’s winning on liquidity and nobody wants to talk about it or invest in it.

this is the real way to lose—by talking about how you’re losing nonstop, while never working to draw builders based on how you’re winning.",,

Risk Assessment | StratCom | Cyber Security | Geo-Threat Assessment | Regional Advisories.","We have seen a video, which long confirms what we have include in the suicide bomber psychological profile, which we will not share. We will tell you the video is from Afghanistan and a training camp run by the Haqqani Network.

In the footage, the bomber, appearing to be around 16 years of age, is visibly distressed, crying, and begging not to proceed with the mission. The Haqqani Network handlers can be clearly heard mocking him and coldly telling him - ""you'll go to heaven directly when you press that red button.""

We also know that some recruits, especially minors, were forcibly drugged with heroin for many years, to create addictions that could be controlled and manipulated, as well as used to suppress fear and resistance when the time came to carry out a mission.

Substances such as benzodiazepines like diazepam, opium-based compounds, or synthetic opioids, like tramadol, were reportedly used to sedate them or create a state of dissociation.

In certain cases, suicide bombers were unknowingly driving vehicles ladened with explosives, which were remotely detonated, making them both victims and perpetrators.

Our own experience of fighting terrorism since 2007 against the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), on the battlefield, has given us many opportunities to interrogate both the suicide bombers and their handlers, when able to capture, rather than neutralise, has greatly enhanced our knowledge of suicide bombing tactics. In short, meaning what we saw in the video is par for the course compared to what we learned in interrogations.

We know, for a fact, that many of the children that were orphaned by the 2005 earthquake in Pakistan, which levelled villages and cities, were left at madrassas without any family to take responsibility for them were used for this purpose. The same was true of the 2007 Lal Masjid standoff in Islamabad, where many of the orphaned children were used as fighters and human shields.

These young bombers were neither martyrs nor militants, but manipulated and drugged pawns.

We are not telling you this to create sympathy for them. We have no sympathy for any terrorist or terror group. 

We are explaining this to you so that you understand that for a terror group, everyone and everything is a weapon to be used. 

Everyone and everything. 

Terror groups have no religion, nation or morality in their decision making. There are just tools, tactics and methods for them to expand their violent machine.

Keep a close eye on children and youth that are estranged from their families. They are easy targets for radicalisation. Once radicalised, they are tool for terror groups to use.",,

________________________________
One huge problem of web3 is that great projects say their hi(s) and bye(s) too fast.

I don't know about you,

 but I am getting tired of seeing project teams with big ideas and huge potential,

 promise us the future.

We get all bullish as hyped as f*ck, 

then they fall off and die very quickly like brown leaves in the summer.

It begs the question, 

Are we really building industry-defining applications on chain,

or just chasing ghosts?

I mean, 

think about it,

As much as we want to call out all the vices and roast Web2, 

 Web2 still has one thing Web3 doesn’t:

🔥 Apps that are embraced and enjoyed by almost 5 billion users globally.

This huge success exists because there were applications that changed and are still changing our lives for good.  

We use them even till today.

Why is that not happening in web3?

It's because the teams with the boldest ideas that could change our lives either:

- don’t have the funds to build,  
- lack the right platforms or 
- don’t have a single mentor who gets it or gives a damn, enough to show up and guide.

And so those ideas?  

They never become the apps that 4.9 billion internet users can’t get enough of.

They just fade away...

Fortunately, that’s about to change

because @BasedIndia is hosting a buildathon that doesn’t just look different than other hackathons...

It builds differently.

How?

The stories you hear about rich families making their servants clean their toilets after every use or throw away plates after every meal.

Call it rich-brain or something. That psychological phenomenon where extreme wealth causes people to lose their mental moorings and spin off into deep space because there's no one left in their lives telling them ""no"" or holding them to any standards of normal human behavior. Where their ability to shape their day to day lives however they want with no limitations lets them fly off into uncharted psychological territory where they'll have whole teams of people orchestrating elaborate scenes and projects to accommodate their debilitating neuroses.

We need a good label for this phenomenon because these are the individuals who are shaping our world. Many people suffering from psychological disorders will come up with unhealthy ideas for how society ought to be run, but they don't have the means to turn their vision into a reality. The people who are made insane by obscene amounts of wealth are not restricted in this way. Their mental illnesses can actually directly influence how human civilization plays out on this planet. 

As billionaires take more and more control over our world, we are finding ourselves increasingly led by those least qualified to lead us. We are a dystopia ruled by lunatics. We should probably do something about that.",,

She said theres no reason for a reader to join the website. So I've had to do some thinking on what could differentiate Sirened from other book cataloguing competitors.

I think the misunderstanding is in intent. Im not building a direct competitor to goodreads per se because im not trying to catalogue every book in existence. The core is referring readers directly to author websites for purchase. IE facilitating the creator-audience relationship, specifically for authors.

So Ive been thinking about gaming strats to give a reader to come. 

I was thinking a weekly/monthly author bash where authors are given a question and write a short response. Readers then rate +- on them or have a keep/toss system and form a leaderboard of popular responses. Winners get put on the winners bookshelf until the next challenge ends. Which would be on the front page.

Then have a boost option for author responses to give their response better visual flair and draw attention to their response card. Then have borders have levels to them so more boost means more shine. If a mechanism like this is the case then profits would be split evenly. It wouldnt be much, but somethings better than nothing.

　The death of Pope Francis shocked the world. It was reported by news media around the world and Christians were left in mourning.

　Personally, I thought he had died of old age. The cause of death was apparently heart failure. Many leaders of various countries and members of the royal families visited and worshipped at the shrine. I'm not a Christian, but I'm currently in Rome, Italy, where I've had two meetings with places that I have a connection to. When I met him, he seemed like a friendly old man and we had a great time talking about soccer. 

　This week, Rome is generally in self-restraint mode, and the people are offering quiet prayers. Of course, events and festivals are canceled or postponed, and stores are closed. 

The most surprising thing was VCVance. He passed away 7 hours after the interview, so I'm worried about his safety and hope he doesn't become traumatized. ( if I am VC Vance I’ll be shocked for while 😱) 

 Bytheway, I'm sure you've all noticed, but the timing of Pop's death seems incredibly strange. 

 This time, let's take a look at the story and who Pop Francisco was.

US-Saudi 🇺🇸 🇸🇦 Relations","One nice thing about owning Bitcoin is that when you go to sleep at night you know that your money is not being used as part of a fiat system of evil and murderous destruction.  

When we use the dollar or other fiat we are sadly participating in a deeply broken, immoral and unethical system.  No matter how well meaning its participants, the entire fiat system itself is corrupt at its core and directly fuels war, for profit prisons and tyranny while robbing people of their purchasing power. 

The broken money system fuels all manner of corruption, violence and inefficiency.   The fiat system influences and corrupts industries ranging from finance to healthcare and even areas like art, academia and publishing. Vast systems of grants and contracts, insider baseball, grifts, donations and kickbacks — most of it legal - doll around trillions of your dollars.  Trillions.   

This fiat money is printed from thin air in unlimited supply and quantity and on the backs of the holders who’s purchasing power is eroded before their eyes.   

Bitcoin is limited in supply and controlled not by politicians but by math and code.  Bitcoin has no power players who can print more money.  

Bitcoin has no special contracts or cronies or kickbacks.  
Bitcoin gives no favors.  
Bitcoin receives no favors.  
Bitcoin can’t influence industries or reward certain people for certain ideologies.  
The Bitcoin code is unaware and uncaring of your political party, name, power or branding.  
Bitcoin says who owns what keys and Bitcoin gives mining rewards to miners - that’s it.  
No coercion no favors or leaders or executives.

The measure of the worth of anything is to imagine yourself without it.","For everyone celebrating Shedeur Sanders slipping to the 5th round, let me explain exactly what happened since some of you clearly need the truth spelled out.

Yes, there were whispers about his interviews. Yes, scouts nitpicked about him holding the ball too long. Yes, some of you clung to Deion Sanders’ comments about not playing for just any team. But if we are being honest, none of these excuses were bigger than the flaws teams overlook every single year for quarterbacks they actually want.

Players with arrests, character red flags, bad tape, and broken mechanics still get drafted early because teams are willing to believe in them. You just were not willing to believe in him because he did not fit the profile you are comfortable with.

The real reason Shedeur fell is simple. NFL front offices got scared of two things.

- First, a player who had the financial freedom to choose his path and would not beg for a roster spot.
- Second, a father who was not going to let them treat his son like property.

The fact that so many of you are celebrating his slide shows exactly what it is. This is not about football. It is about your Schadenfreude. You are desperate to see a confident, independent player stumble because it makes you feel better about your own failures. That is all this is.

Shedeur’s fall had nothing to do with his ability and everything to do with NFL politics and fear of losing control. Even Cleveland, who passed on him multiple times earlier, finally realized the value was too obvious to ignore.",,

JORDAN HAS NOT BANNED THE  MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD. Jordan’s regime outlawed a defunct entity—the so-called “Muslim Brotherhood ASSOCIATION,” which had already been dissolved in 2020. Meanwhile, the Muslim Brotherhood SOCIETY remains legal, registered, and fully operational. The Muslim Brotherhood’s political arm, the ISLAMIC ACTION FRONT PARTY, is also legal and thriving.

Last night on the BBC, I directly challenged the king to ban both the Brotherhood Society and the Islamic Action Front. He wouldn’t—because the MB is his own party, his father said “The MB is the Hashemite state’s own party”/ the king is the Mb and the MB is the king. The king is attempting to deceive Trump and others into believing he’s cracked down on the Brotherhood, when in reality, it continues to operate freely in Jordan.

The DA has notable white support, with 30% of its voters being white, and its policies often align with economic interests linked to historical white privilege. However, direct control lacks clear evidence, as parties like the ANC have predominantly black leadership and voter bases. The MK Party, led by Zuma, also faces this accusation, but proof is scarce.
